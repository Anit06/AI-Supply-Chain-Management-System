train_model.py
===============
Trains a NEXT-MONTH stock demand model using the ENTIRE available
monthly demand history for every (warehouse, product) combination,
instead of only two lag features.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY THIS VERSION IS DIFFERENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The old model used exactly two numeric features:
    previousMonthDemand
    sameMonthLastYearDemand

This version instead builds a rolling time-series feature vector

    month_1, month_2, ..., month_N

where month_1 is the OLDEST month in the lookback window and month_N
is the most recent one. The number of columns (N) is NOT hardcoded.
It is computed automatically from whatever history is available in
monthly_sales_history.csv at training time (MAX_LOOKBACK below). If
you add more months of data next year and retrain, N grows on its
own and the model is retrained with a wider window.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
SLIDING WINDOW TRAINING SAMPLES
--------------------------------------------------------------------
For every warehouse-product combo, every *contiguous* run of months
(no calendar gaps) is turned into many training rows via a sliding
window, e.g. for Jan..Aug:

    Jan Feb Mar             -> predict Apr
    Jan Feb Mar Apr         -> predict May
    Jan Feb Mar Apr May     -> predict Jun
    Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun -> predict Jul
    ...

The minimum window length is MIN_LOOKBACK (default 3 months) so the
model always has some sequence to learn from. Windows shorter than
the global MAX_LOOKBACK are LEFT-PADDED with zeros, and a
"historyLength" feature tells the model how many of the month_N
columns are real vs. padding, so it can learn to discount padding
rather than being confused by it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNTIME / LIVE DATA
--------------------------------------------------------------------
This script only trains on the CSV. At prediction time your Flask
service is expected to:
  1. Load demand_model_monthly.pkl (contains the pipeline PLUS the
     metadata needed to rebuild an identical feature vector: the
     max_lookback width, the ordered feature/column names, and the
     min_lookback).
  2. Take the CSV history for a warehouse/product (via
     model_options.json, which is still produced here) and APPEND
     the live month pulled from MongoDB via the Node API (e.g. live
     July 2026 demand) to that combo's history.
  3. Build the same month_1..month_N (+ historyLength) vector from
     that combined history (left-padding the same way) and call
     pipeline.predict(...) to get next month's (e.g. August 2026)
     demand.

Data required: monthly_sales_history.csv with columns:
    warehouseName, productName, category, year, month, monthName,
    season, monthlyDemand

Run:
    python train_model.py

Produces:
    - demand_model_monthly.pkl   (dict: pipeline + feature metadata)
    - model_options.json         (warehouse/product/category choices,
                                   full monthly history per combo, and
                                   the same feature metadata so the
                                   Flask service can reconstruct
                                   vectors identically)
